						<h3>Hardbanding</h3>
						<p>Hardbanding has long been acknowledged as an effective means of preventing tool joint wear. During the 1990â€™s, tungsten carbide-based hardbanding was in widespread use and was determined to be the primary cause of casing wear. However the absence of hardbanding, while slowing casing wear to a small degree, allowed the tool joints to wear at an accelerated rate, lessening the torsional capacity of the drill pipe and putting drilling operations at a serious risk. The challenge was to discover a balanced, simultaneously effective solution between both casing wear defense and tool joint protection, which is caused by the worsening conditions associated with highly deviated ERD wells. Previous casing friendly alloys reduced casing wear, but produced unacceptable tool joint wear as a consequence. Crack-prone design flaws were also present, as widespread cracking of the alloy material often ensued. This caused catastrophic tool joint failure and in some cases, even the failure of the hardbanding itself, due to tool joint spalling.</p>

						<p>WellWare has been performing hardbanding in the Norwegian market for more than 10 years. Due to excellent co-operation between WellWare and Statoil, there has been very successful development, use and approval of our innovative LoWare alloys. </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Casing material combined with full-size, hardbanding alloy-infused wear samples.</li>
							<li>Specific mud parameters, measuring tool-joint, open hole and casing wear rates.</li>
							<li>Established hardbanding coating friction dynamics.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In addition to this, we use an automated Micro Hardness Machine, a G65 Abrasion Wear-Test Machine and ICP / XRF Chemical Analysis Units, employing a well trained, customer-oriented technical team. Our global crew of highly qualified engineers tests LoWare products on active field components, under the most extreme drilling conditions. These harsh environments provide the necessary criteria for understanding severe wear phenomena and set the standard by which we measure our product integrity.</p>

						<h3>Steel Industry</h3>
						<p>In steel plants, equipment that processes sinter at very high temperature is exposed to severe wear conditions. In particular, the sinter crusher that has to ensure large through-put must be wear-protected in order to avoid expensive maintenance and frequent plant shutdowns. Maintenance Managers agree that standard solutions available on the market are not sufficient for their needs. Rotors and breaker bars must regularly be replaced with new ones.</p>
						<p>The insufficient wear resistance of the standard solutions is due to three main factors:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the sinter high temperature that reduces the hardfacing characteristics.</li>
							<li>the sinter abrasive nature that wears-out the parts.</li>
							<li>the high impacts that destroy brittle hardfacings.</li>
						</ul>

						</div>
						<p>LoWare is a legally protected solution specifically developed for improving steel sinter crusher productivity and service life. This solution is born after 4 years of tests made in laboratory as well as on real working conditions. It is based on a unique WellWare high temperature wear-resistant alloy that offers extreme resistance even when impact and abrasion are present. LoWare is particularly suitable for protecting the critical sinter crusher parts such as the rotor discs, teeth and breaker bars. On-site tests have shown that LoWare outperforms standard solutions by at least a factor 3. In addition to increasing service life, the geometrical shape of the parts is preserved, which ensures better crusher efficiency compared to standard solutions.</p>
